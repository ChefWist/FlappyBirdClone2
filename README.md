<h2>Introduction 🎮</h2>
<p>Welcome to <a href="">Flappy Bird Clone 2</a>. This game is a remake of the original flappy bird which you can no longer play. I created this whole game in java using swing. Assets came from <a href="https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h2>Positives ✅</h2>
<p>I have successfulluy created a clone of Flappy bird in just Java. I have also used <strong>all</strong> of the assets that were provided. When I was playtesting, I found that there was nothing wrong with the game!</p>
<h2>Things to improve on ❌</h2>
<p>I think there was nothing to improve on in this clone except for making more features for the game!</p>
<h2>What I learnt 📕</h2>
<p>Through the process of making this game, I have learnt how to create a custom font using images of seperate letters!</p>
<h2>Overall 🔚</h2>
<p>Overall, I would say that I have done an anmazing job at almost making a perfect clone of the original Flappy Bird game.</p>
